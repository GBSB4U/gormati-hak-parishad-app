GorMati Hak Parishad – PWA
Citizen Hak Infrastructure | A GBSB4U Initiative
🔰 Introduction
GorMati Hak Parishad is a citizen-first digital infrastructure designed to enable people to present, record, and track their rightful issues (Hak) in a transparent, dignified, and non-political manner.
This platform is not a political app, not an NGO portal, and not a complaint box.
It is a rights-centric civic system guided by ethical governance principles.
🌍 Guiding Philosophy
Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam
The world is one family.
This platform believes:
A citizen is not a “case number”
Rights precede bureaucracy
Technology must serve justice, not power
Systems must empower people, not intimidate them
🎯 Why GorMati Hak Parishad?
Across systems, citizens face:
Endless paperwork
Fear of authority
Lack of transparency
Politicization of genuine issues
No status clarity after submission
GorMati Hak Parishad exists to correct this imbalance.
